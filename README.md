# MovieQuoteGenerator

A small project I started to apply my new knowledge of JavaScript revealing module design pattern and promises. Still refining my JavaScript skills and learning how to better structure and design my code. This is a simple webapp that generates random movie quotes using Mashape's quotes API.

1. Users can click a button to obtain and display a new random quote.
2. Users can click a button to tweet out their quote.
